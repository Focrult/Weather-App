## Weather-App
# Challenge #6 - Week 6:

# Project Description
### What is this project?
This weeks project is to develop a functional Weather-Dashboard. My goal for this project is to take advantage of the OpenWeather API, allow the user to select a city of their choice and view its current weather. Moreover, the user will be able to see a five day forecast of their chosen city. Each city that is searched by the user will be saved and visible on a seperate column, presented as the users search history. Additionally each previous city tab is interactive for the user to return if they require. If under any circumstance the users browser was to close or the tab removed, this dashboard utilises the localStorage to store persistent data to prevent any loss of history!

### Files modified
Throughout this project I have heavily worked on the index.html and script.js files. 

### Challenges
Server-API's were an area that I have not read as heavily as I should have, and is apparent throughout my commits. I tackled the project reasonably well originally and then later down the road discovered numerous bugs, road blocks and sections that required improvements/changes. Storing the cities in localStorage was a problem that I later resolved. However, I consistently failed and struggled with the search history interface. Enabling the user to update the weather dashboard if they were to click on a search history tab. There were numerous bugs and problems that I didn't manage to resolve for several days.

The usage for this project is to enable users to add and record a city that they wish to travel to. Providing an accurate outlook for any city of the users choice, so that they can plan a trip according to the weather.
